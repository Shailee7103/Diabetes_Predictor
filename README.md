# Diabetes_Predictor
SVM for Diabetes Prediction
This project uses the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on a dataset containing various health-related features.
The dataset includes columns such as the number of pregnancies, glucose levels, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin levels, BMI, diabetes pedigree function, age, and the outcome indicating whether the person has diabetes (1) or not (0). 
The SVM model is trained on this data to classify individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic based on these input features. 
The goal of this project is to demonstrate how machine learning techniques can be used for health prediction tasks, particularly in identifying individuals at risk for diabetes.
